## 11. Alignment with Standardization Efforts

### 11.1. Community Alignment

This architecture aligns with the goals of the **W3C CRDT for RDF Community Group**.

### 11.2. Architectural Differentiators

* **"Add-on" vs. "Database":** This specification is designed for "add-on" libraries. The developer retains control over their local storage and querying logic.
* **CRDT Interoperability over Convenience:** The primary rule is that CRDT-managed data must be clean, standard RDF within `sync:ManagedDocument` containers, enabling safe collaboration among CRDT-enabled applications while remaining protected from incompatible applications.
* **Transparent Logic:** The merge logic is not a "black box." By using the `sync:isGovernedBy` link, the rules for conflict resolution become a public, inspectable part of the data model itself.

## 12. Glossary

**CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type)**: Data structure that can be safely replicated and merged without coordination, guaranteeing convergent outcomes.

**FullIndex**: Monolithic index covering an entire dataset, suitable for small collections (< 1000 resources).

**GroupIndexTemplate**: Template defining how data is grouped into separate indices, enabling scalable organization of large datasets.

**Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC)**: Causality tracking mechanism combining logical time (tamper-resistant) with physical timestamps (intuitive tie-breaking).

**Installation**: Single instance of an application on a specific device, identified by a unique IRI and serving as the CRDT "actor" or "node ID".

**LWW-Register (Last-Writer-Wins Register)**: CRDT type where the most recent value (based on Hybrid Logical Clock) wins during conflicts.

**Merge Contract**: Public RDF document defining how to merge conflicting changes for specific data properties, referenced via `sync:isGovernedBy`.

**OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set)**: CRDT set type supporting additions and explicit removals, commonly used for multi-value properties.

**Pod**: Solid personal data storage space providing web-based access control and RDF data storage.

**sync:ManagedDocument**: Framework wrapper around RDF resources that enables CRDT synchronization and conflict resolution.

**Sync Strategy**: High-level performance pattern (FullSync, GroupedSync, OnDemandSync) determining when and how data is synchronized.

**Tombstone**: Deletion marker in CRDT systems, either at document level (`crdt:deletedAt`) or property level (RDF reification).

**Type Index**: Solid discovery mechanism registering data types and their storage locations within a Pod.

**Universal Emptying**: Process of removing all semantic content from tombstoned documents while preserving framework metadata.

**WebID**: Unique identifier for users in the Solid ecosystem, serving as both identity and profile location.
