### 11.2. Architectural Differentiators

* **"Add-on" vs. "Database":** This specification is designed for "add-on" libraries. The developer retains control over their local storage and querying logic.
* **CRDT Interoperability over Convenience:** The primary rule is that CRDT-managed data must be clean, standard RDF within `sync:ManagedDocument` containers, enabling safe collaboration among CRDT-enabled applications while remaining protected from incompatible applications.
* **Transparent Logic:** The merge logic is not a "black box." By using the `sync:isGovernedBy` link, the rules for conflict resolution become a public, inspectable part of the data model itself.
