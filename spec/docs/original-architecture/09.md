## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1. Threat Model

This framework operates within the **Solid security model** where:
- **Pod access control** (WAC/ACP) provides primary security boundaries
- **WebID-based authentication** establishes user identity
- **Pods are trusted storage** - no protection against malicious Pod providers
- **Network communication** relies on HTTPS for transport security

### 9.2. Data Integrity and Authenticity

**Tamper Resistance:**
- **Hybrid Logical Clocks** provide tamper-resistant causality tracking through logical time counters
- **Cryptographic hash verification** of index shard states detects data corruption
- **CRDT merge semantics** ensure convergent outcomes regardless of operation order

**Limitations:**
- No cryptographic signatures on data - integrity depends on Pod provider trustworthiness
- Malicious Pod providers could manipulate stored data
- Hybrid Logical Clock physical timestamps are user-controlled (trusted for tie-breaking only)

### 9.3. Privacy and Access Control

**Access Patterns:**
- Framework **respects Pod access control** but does not enforce additional restrictions
- **Index structures may leak metadata** about data organization and access patterns
- **Installation documents** contain user device/application metadata visible to collaborators

**Privacy Considerations:**
- **Collaborative visibility**: All installations in a Pod can see framework metadata and index structures
- **Temporal information**: Hybrid Logical Clocks reveal rough timing and causality of changes
- **No end-to-end encryption** - data protection relies entirely on Pod provider security

### 9.4. Authentication and Authorization

**Current Scope:**
- Framework **assumes valid WebID authentication** handled by external mechanisms
- **Permission failures** trigger graceful degradation to local-only operation
- **No proactive permission checking** - operations may fail due to access control changes

**OAuth/OIDC Security:**
For critical security considerations regarding redirect URI configuration in Solid OIDC authentication, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). This covers platform-specific best practices for preventing authorization code interception and client impersonation attacks.

**Future Enhancements:**
For proactive access control integration and advanced security features, see [FUTURE-TOPICS.md](FUTURE-TOPICS.md) sections 13-15.
