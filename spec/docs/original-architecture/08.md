## 8. Error Handling and Resilience

While the synchronization workflow provides the ideal path for data consistency, real-world distributed systems face numerous failure modes that can disrupt this process. The architecture provides comprehensive strategies for maintaining consistency and availability despite various error conditions, ensuring the system remains robust across network failures, server outages, access control changes, and data corruption scenarios.

### 8.1. Failure Classification

**Error Granularities:**
- **Type-Level:** Entire data type cannot sync (missing merge contracts, authentication failures)
- **Resource-Level:** Individual resource blocked (parse errors, access control changes)  
- **Property-Level:** Specific property cannot sync (unknown CRDT types, schema violations)

### 8.2. Core Resilience Strategies

**Network Resilience:**
- Distinguish between systemic failures (abort entire sync) vs. resource-specific failures (skip and continue)
- Exponential backoff for systemic issues, immediate retry for individual resources
- Offline operation continues with local Hybrid Logical Clock increments

**Discovery and Setup:**
- Comprehensive Pod setup process with user consent for configuration changes
- Graceful fallback to hardcoded paths if discovery fails
- Progressive disclosure: automatic vs. custom setup options

**Data Integrity:**
- Index inconsistency detection and automatic resolution
- CRDT merge conflict resolution at property level
- Hybrid Logical Clock anomaly detection and handling

### 8.3. Graceful Degradation

The system provides two operational modes based on sync availability:

1. **Full Functionality:** Complete discovery, sync, and merge operations
2. **Sync Disabled:** Full local functionality with sync operations disabled until connectivity/permissions restored
