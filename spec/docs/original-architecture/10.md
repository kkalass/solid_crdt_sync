## 10. Benefits of this Architecture

* **CRDT Interoperability:** CRDT-enabled applications achieve safe collaboration by discovering CRDT-managed resources through `sync:ManagedDocument` registrations and following published merge contracts, while remaining protected from interference by incompatible applications.
* **Developer-Centric Flexibility:** The Sync Strategy model empowers the developer to choose the right performance trade-offs for their specific data.
* **Controlled Discoverability:** The system is discoverable by CRDT-enabled applications while protecting CRDT-managed data from accidental modification by incompatible applications.
* **High Performance & Consistency:** The RDF-based sharded index and state-based sync with HTTP caching ensure that synchronization is fast and bandwidth-efficient.
