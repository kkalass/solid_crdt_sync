# PaCoRS: Passive Storage Collaborative RDF Sync System

A comprehensive specification and Dart/Flutter implementation for building **local-first, collaborative, and truly interoperable applications** using passive storage backends with RDF and CRDT synchronization.

## Overview

This project addresses the fundamental challenge of creating applications that are both **conflict-free** (using CRDT algorithms) and **semantically interoperable** (using standard RDF vocabularies) while maintaining high performance regardless of dataset size. The system works with passive storage backends, with Solid Pods being the primary focus but not the only option.

### Key Features

- **🔄 Conflict-Free Synchronization**: State-based CRDT algorithms ensure safe collaboration without coordination
- **🌐 Semantic Interoperability**: All data stored as clean, standard RDF for maximum compatibility  
- **⚡ Performance at Scale**: Three sync strategies (Full, Grouped, On-Demand) handle datasets from 100 to 100,000+ resources
- **📱 Local-First**: Full offline functionality with sync when connectivity is available
- **🔒 Privacy-Preserving**: Maintains user data ownership with pluggable access control systems

## Quick Start

### For Specification Writers
The complete architecture is documented in **[spec/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](spec/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

### For Application Developers
The Dart implementation is in early development. The current focus is on establishing the core architecture and interfaces.

📋 **For package structure, current status, and development workflow, see [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md)**

### For Framework Implementers  
This specification is designed to be **language-agnostic**. The Dart implementation serves as a reference, but the architecture supports implementations in JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.

## Project Scope

This repository serves **dual purposes**:

### 📋 1. Specification
Complete architectural documentation for building CRDT-enabled applications with passive storage backends across any programming language. The specification lives in the **[`spec/`](spec/)** directory and includes:

- **Complete CRDT-RDF architecture** with formal vocabulary definitions
- **Language-agnostic design patterns** for implementers
- **Performance analysis** and optimization strategies  
- **Interoperability contracts** for cross-application compatibility

### 🛠️ 2. Dart Implementation (In Development)
A multipackage Dart library that aims to become production-ready for real-world applications. The implementation will provide:

- **Full-featured library** for building collaborative applications with passive storage backends
- **Complete API coverage** of the specification's capabilities
- **Performance-optimized** implementation suitable for mobile and web applications
- **Reference example** for implementers in other languages

*Note: Implementation is currently in early development - the specification came first to ensure a solid foundation.*

## Architecture Overview

The framework uses a **4-layer architecture**:

1. **Data Resource Layer**: Clean RDF resources using standard vocabularies
2. **Merge Contract Layer**: Public CRDT rules for conflict resolution  
3. **Indexing Layer**: Efficient change detection and performance optimization
4. **Sync Strategy Layer**: Application-specific performance trade-offs

```turtle
# Example: Recipe with automatic conflict resolution
<#recipe> a schema:Recipe;
  schema:name "Tomato Soup";           # LWW-Register (last writer wins)
  schema:keywords "vegan", "soup";     # OR-Set (additions/removals merge)
  schema:cookTime "PT30M" .            # Immutable (cannot be changed)

<> a sync:ManagedDocument;
   sync:isGovernedBy <https://app.example/contracts/recipe-v1>;
   foaf:primaryTopic <#recipe> .
```

## AI Assistance Acknowledgment

This specification was developed with assistance from large language models (Claude, Gemini) for:
- **Research assistance**: Exploring CRDT literature, Solid ecosystem standards, and related work
- **Technical writing and editing**: Improving clarity, consistency, and professional formatting
- **Architecture review**: Identifying gaps, inconsistencies, and improvement opportunities  
- **Documentation structure**: Organizing complex technical concepts for multiple audiences

**Human oversight**: All architectural decisions, technical approaches, and conceptual frameworks remain under full human authorship and responsibility. AI tools served as sophisticated writing and analysis assistants, not as sources of technical authority.

**Quality assurance**: The specification's technical validity comes from careful review, implementation experience, and community feedback - not from AI generation.
