# CRDT Specification for RDF Synchronization

This document provides the detailed algorithms and mechanics for implementing state-based CRDTs with RDF data in the Solid ecosystem.

## 1. Overview

This specification defines how to implement conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for RDF resources, enabling automatic synchronization without coordination between replicas.

**Core Principles:**
- **State-based**: Entire resource state is synchronized, not operations
- **RDF-native**: Uses RDF vocabularies and structures throughout
- **Property-level**: Different CRDT types can be applied to different properties
- **Hybrid Logical Clock causality**: Determines merge order and conflict resolution using both logical time (causality) and physical time (intuitive tie-breaking)
- **RDF Reification for tombstones**: Uses RDF Reification to represent deleted statements, which is semantically correct since it describes statements without asserting them (unlike RDF-Star which would assert the triple being "deleted")

**Key Innovation - Hybrid Logical Clocks**: This specification uses Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) instead of traditional vector clocks to provide both rigorous causality tracking AND intuitive tie-breaking. When operations are truly concurrent (no causal relationship), the framework uses physical timestamps to implement "most recent wins" semantics that align with user expectations, while maintaining tamper-proof causality through logical time counters.

## 2. Hybrid Logical Clock Mechanics

### 2.1. Hybrid Logical Clock Structure

Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) combine the benefits of logical clocks (causality tracking) with physical clocks (intuitive timing). Each clock entry tracks both logical time (tamper-proof causality) and physical time (wall-clock for tie-breaking):

```turtle
<> crdt:hasClockEntry [
     crdt:installationId <https://alice.podprovider.org/installations/mobile-recipe-app-2024-08-19-xyz>;
     crdt:logicalTime "3"^^xsd:long ;
     crdt:physicalTime "1693824600000"^^xsd:long
   ], [
     crdt:installationId <https://bob.podprovider.org/installations/desktop-recipe-app-2024-08-15-abc>;
     crdt:logicalTime "1"^^xsd:long ;
     crdt:physicalTime "1693824550000"^^xsd:long
   ];
   crdt:clockHash "xxh64:abc123" .
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Logical Time**: Monotonically increasing counter (like traditional vector clocks) that tracks causality
- **Physical Time**: Wall-clock timestamp in milliseconds since Unix epoch for intuitive tie-breaking
- **Installation ID**: Unique identifier for each application installation

### 2.2. Causality Determination

**Clock Comparison Rules:**
- Clock A **dominates** Clock B if A.logical[i] ≥ B.logical[i] for all installations i, and A.logical[j] > B.logical[j] for at least one installation j
- If A.logical[i] == B.logical[i] for all installations i, the clocks are **identical** (no merge needed)
- If neither dominates based on logical time, the changes are **concurrent** and require physical time tie-breaking

**Empty/Missing Clock Handling:**
- **Missing/empty clock**: Treated as Hybrid Logical Clock with all zeros (logical=0, physical=0, no installation entries)
- **One-side empty**: Empty clock is always dominated by any present clock (loses merge comparison)
- **Both-sides empty**: If values are equal, no conflict. If values differ, local value wins (deterministic local-wins policy)
- **Template clock recommendation**: Templates should use minimal clocks (logical=1, physical=0) instead of empty clocks to ensure proper CRDT participation while guaranteeing loss in tie-breaking scenarios
- **Semantic meaning**: Missing clock indicates "this installation has never modified this property"

### 2.3. Hybrid Logical Clock Operations

**On Local Update:**
1. Get current physical time: `now = currentTimeMillis()`
2. Advance logical time: `logicalTime = max(logicalTime + 1, now)`
3. Set physical time: `physicalTime = now`
4. Update `crdt:clockHash` with new hash
5. Apply changes to resource

**On Merge:**
1. Create result logical clock: `result.logical[i] = max(A.logical[i], B.logical[i])` for each installation i
2. Create result physical clock: `result.physical[i] = max(A.physical[i], B.physical[i])` for each installation i  
3. Increment merging installation's logical time: `result.logical[mergingInstallation]++`
4. Set merging installation's physical time: `result.physical[mergingInstallation] = currentTimeMillis()`
5. Update hash: `crdt:clockHash = hash(result)`

**Clock Manipulation Resilience:**
Even if a user manipulates their system clock, the logical time component ensures causality is preserved:
- **Normal operation**: `logicalTime = max(5 + 1, 1693824600000) = 1693824600000`
- **Clock reset**: `logicalTime = max(5 + 1, 1693820000000) = 6` (logical time protects causality)

**Why Hybrid Logical Clocks?**

Hybrid Logical Clocks provide three critical benefits over traditional approaches:

1. **Tamper-Proof Causality**: The logical time component acts as a safety net against clock manipulation, ensuring that causality relationships are preserved even when users accidentally or maliciously adjust their system clocks.

2. **Intuitive Tie-Breaking**: When operations are truly concurrent (logical clocks don't establish dominance), physical time provides "most recent wins" semantics that align with user expectations.

3. **Related Change Coherence**: Operations performed together (like updating a recipe name and its ingredients) tend to have similar physical timestamps, ensuring they win or lose together across properties and even across documents, maintaining semantic consistency.

**Hybrid Logical Clocks vs Pure Timestamps vs Traditional Vector Clocks:**

| Approach | Causality Tracking | Tie-Breaking | Clock Manipulation | Implementation |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Traditional Vector Clocks** | ✅ Perfect | ❌ Arbitrary (installation ID) | ✅ Immune | ✅ Simple |
| **Pure Timestamps** | ⚠️ Fragile | ✅ Intuitive | ❌ Vulnerable | ✅ Simple |
| **Hybrid Logical Clocks** | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Intuitive | ✅ Immune | ⚠️ More Complex |

The framework uses Hybrid Logical Clocks because they provide the best combination of theoretical soundness (proper causality) and practical usability (intuitive conflict resolution).

### 2.4. Hybrid Logical Clocks vs Timestamps: Complementary Systems

**Three Complementary Systems:** The framework uses Hybrid Logical Clocks, `crdt:deletedAt` timestamps, and physical time tie-breaking, each serving distinct purposes:

**Hybrid Logical Clocks (Causality Determination + Tie-Breaking):**
- **Logical Time Purpose:** Determine which updates happened "before" or "after" others during merge conflicts (traditional vector clock semantics)
- **Physical Time Purpose:** Provide intuitive tie-breaking when operations are truly concurrent ("most recent wins")
- **Usage:** Compare document-level logical clocks to resolve OR-Set add vs remove conflicts, use physical time for LWW-Register tie-breaking
- **Example:** When merging conflicting states where Alice's version contains "spicy" (with document logical clock [Alice:5, Bob:4]) and Bob's version has tombstoned "spicy" (with document logical clock [Alice:3, Bob:4] when tombstone was created), Alice's add wins because her document logical clock dominates the tombstone's creation clock

**`crdt:deletedAt` Timestamps (Deletion State & Cleanup):**
- **Purpose:** Mark what is currently deleted and enable time-based cleanup policies  
- **Usage:** OR-Set semantics for deletion/undeletion cycles, garbage collection timing
- **Example:** `crdt:deletedAt "2024-09-02T14:30:00Z"` marks a property value as deleted, supporting later undeletion by adding more timestamps

**The Relationship:** Hybrid Logical Clocks answer "who wins during conflicts?" (via logical time) and "which concurrent change feels more recent?" (via physical time), while deletion timestamps answer "what is currently deleted and when can we clean it up?" All three systems work together - logical time drives CRDT merge logic, physical time provides intuitive tie-breaking, and deletion timestamps handle deletion semantics and eventual cleanup.

## 3. CRDT Types and Algorithms

### 3.1. LWW-Register (Last Writer Wins Register)

Used for properties where only the most recent value matters.

**Merge Algorithm:**
When merging two versions of a resource, A and B:
```
merge(A, B):
  // Handle empty/missing clocks first
  if A.logicalClock is empty and B.logicalClock is empty:
    if A.value == B.value:
      return A.value  // No conflict
    else:
      // Both sides uninitialized but different values - local wins deterministically
      return A.value  // A is local, B is remote
  elif A.logicalClock is empty:
    return B.value  // Empty clock always loses
  elif B.logicalClock is empty:
    return A.value  // Empty clock always loses
    
  // Normal CRDT comparison for non-empty clocks
  if A.logicalClock dominates B.logicalClock:
    return A.value
  elif B.logicalClock dominates A.logicalClock:
    return B.value
  else: // Concurrent change - logical clocks don't establish dominance
    // Use physical time for intuitive tie-breaking
    A_maxPhysicalTime = max(A.physicalTime[i] for all installations i)
    B_maxPhysicalTime = max(B.physicalTime[i] for all installations i)
    if A_maxPhysicalTime > B_maxPhysicalTime:
        return A.value
    elif B_maxPhysicalTime > A_maxPhysicalTime:
        return B.value
    else: // Same physical time - fallback to installation ID
        A_maxInstallation = installation with max physical time in A
        B_maxInstallation = installation with max physical time in B
        if A_maxInstallation > B_maxInstallation:
            return A.value
        else:
            return B.value
```

**Example:**
```turtle
# Alice's version (logical clock dominates)
schema:name "Tomato Basil Soup"

# Bob's version (logical clock dominated)  
schema:name "Tomato Soup"

# Result: "Tomato Basil Soup" (Alice's logical clock wins)

# Concurrent example (logical clocks don't dominate):
# Alice: logical=[Alice:5, Bob:5], physical=[Alice:1693824600000, Bob:1693824590000]
# Bob:   logical=[Alice:5, Bob:5], physical=[Alice:1693824600000, Bob:1693824650000]
# Result: Bob's value wins (higher physical time: 1693824650000 > 1693824600000)
```

### 3.2. 2P-Set (Two-Phase Set)

A 2P-Set is used for multi-value properties where removal is permanent. Once an element is removed, it cannot be re-added.

**RDF Representation:**
- **Additions:** The presence of a triple in the resource (e.g., `:it schema:keywords "vegan"`) signifies that the value is in the set.
- **Removals:** A removal is marked with a tombstone using RDF Reification with `crdt:deletedAt` timestamp, which is semantically correct for representing deleted statements without asserting them.

```turtle
# The tombstone marks the triple as deleted using RDF Reification
# Fragment identifier generated deterministically from the deleted triple
<#crdt-tombstone-8f2a1c7d> a rdf:Statement;
  rdf:subject :it;
  rdf:predicate schema:keywords;
  rdf:object "vegan";
  crdt:deletedAt "2024-09-02T14:30:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
```

**Merge Algorithm:**
The merge of two replicas, A and B, is the union of their elements minus the union of their tombstones.
1.  `merged_elements = elements(A) ∪ elements(B)`
2.  `merged_tombstones = tombstones(A) ∪ tombstones(B)`
3.  `result = { e | e ∈ merged_elements and e ∉ merged_tombstones }`

**Limitation:** Because tombstones are simple truthy values without causality information, they are permanent. If a value is removed, it can never be re-added, as the tombstone will always cause it to be removed during a merge.

### 3.3. OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set) with Add-Wins

A true OR-Set allows elements to be added and removed multiple times. The recommended implementation for this framework uses an "Add-Wins" semantic, which is efficient and avoids the metadata overhead of traditional tagged OR-Sets.

An element's presence is determined by comparing the causality information of its addition (the document-level logical clock) and its removal (using the document-level logical clock at removal time).

**RDF Representation:**
- **Additions:** The presence of a triple in a version of a resource implies an "add" operation whose causality is tracked by the document-level logical clock.
- **Removals:** A removal is marked with a **tombstone** using RDF Reification. The tombstone stores a `crdt:deletedAt` timestamp for deletion state, while causality comparison uses the document-level logical clock from when the tombstone was created.

**Tombstone Structure:**
```turtle
# Simple tombstone using RDF Reification (semantically correct for deletions)
# Fragment identifier generated deterministically from the deleted triple
<#crdt-tombstone-a1b2c3d4> a rdf:Statement;
  rdf:subject :it;
  rdf:predicate schema:keywords;
  rdf:object "spicy";
  crdt:deletedAt "2024-09-02T14:30:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .

# The causality of this tombstone (for merge conflicts) is determined by the document-level logical clock:
<> crdt:hasClockEntry [
    crdt:installationId <installation-that-deleted>;
    crdt:logicalTime "5"^^xsd:long ;
    crdt:physicalTime "1693824590000"^^xsd:long
  ], [
    crdt:installationId <other-installation>;
    crdt:logicalTime "8"^^xsd:long ;
    crdt:physicalTime "1693824600000"^^xsd:long
  ] .
```

**Merge Algorithm (Add-Wins):**
When merging two replicas, A and B, every potential element `e` is decided by comparing the document-level clocks of the conflicting states (add vs. remove).

For each element `e`:
- If `e` exists in A and not in B (and no tombstone for `e` exists in B), it is kept.
- If `e` exists in A and is tombstoned in B:
    1. Get the document-level logical clock from document A: `add_logical_clock`.
    2. Get the document-level logical clock from document B (where the tombstone was created): `remove_logical_clock`.
    3. If `add_logical_clock` dominates `remove_logical_clock`, the add is newer. The element is kept and the tombstone is discarded.
    4. If `remove_logical_clock` dominates `add_logical_clock`, the remove is newer. The element is removed.
    5. If the logical clocks are concurrent, use physical time tie-breaking:
       - Compare `max(add_physical_time)` vs `max(remove_physical_time)`
       - **The recommended policy is Add-Wins on equal physical times**, meaning the element is kept if physical times are identical. This ensures that if two users concurrently add and remove the same item at the exact same time, it is preserved.
- The final document-level Hybrid Logical Clock of the merged document uses standard merge algorithms (max of logical times, max of physical times for each installation).

This Add-Wins approach provides the desired OR-Set semantics (elements can be re-added) without requiring complex tags on every set element, thus preserving the clean, interoperable nature of the RDF data.

**Detailed OR-Set Merge Algorithm:**

```
mergeORSet(localElements, localTombstones, localLogicalClock, localPhysicalClock,
          remoteElements, remoteTombstones, remoteLogicalClock, remotePhysicalClock):
  
  // Combine all elements and tombstones from both replicas
  allElements = localElements ∪ remoteElements
  allTombstones = localTombstones ∪ remoteTombstones
  
  result = {}
  
  for each element e in allElements:
    isDeleted = false
    
    // Check if element is tombstoned in either replica
    for each tombstone t in allTombstones:
      if t.targets(e):
        // Compare element's presence clock vs tombstone's creation clock
        elementLogicalClock = logicalClockWhenElementWasAdded(e, ...)
        elementPhysicalClock = physicalClockWhenElementWasAdded(e, ...)
        tombstoneLogicalClock = logicalClockWhenTombstoneWasCreated(t, ...)
        tombstonePhysicalClock = physicalClockWhenTombstoneWasCreated(t, ...)
        
        // Handle empty/missing clocks for element and tombstone
        if elementLogicalClock is empty and tombstoneLogicalClock is empty:
          // Both uninitialized - element wins (Add-Wins policy for OR-Set)
          continue
        elif elementLogicalClock is empty and tombstoneLogicalClock is not empty:
          // Element never had a proper write, tombstone wins
          isDeleted = true
          break
        elif elementLogicalClock is not empty and tombstoneLogicalClock is empty:
          // Tombstone never had proper write, element wins
          continue
        elif tombstoneLogicalClock dominates elementLogicalClock:
          isDeleted = true
          break
        elif elementLogicalClock dominates tombstoneLogicalClock:
          continue  // Element wins, ignore this tombstone
        else: // Concurrent logical clocks - use physical time tie-breaking
          maxElementPhysical = max(elementPhysicalClock.values())
          maxTombstonePhysical = max(tombstonePhysicalClock.values())
          if maxTombstonePhysical > maxElementPhysical:
            isDeleted = true
            break
          else:
            // Add-Wins policy: keep element on equal/lower tombstone physical time
            continue
    
    if not isDeleted:
      result.add(e)
  
  return result
```

**Undeletion Mechanics and Recursion Handling:**

The OR-Set semantics for `crdt:deletedAt` enables undeletion through tombstone-of-tombstone creation:

**Undeletion Process:**
1. **Target Specific Timestamp:** Create tombstone targeting the specific `crdt:deletedAt` timestamp to be removed
2. **Self-Limiting Recursion:** Each delete/undelete cycle uses fresh timestamps, preventing infinite recursion
3. **Temporal Differentiation:** Tombstones target specific historical deletion events, not the deletion mechanism itself

**Example Cycle:**
```turtle
# Step 1: Delete "spicy" 
<#tomb-1> rdf:subject :it; rdf:predicate schema:keywords; rdf:object "spicy";
          crdt:deletedAt "2024-09-02T14:30:00Z" .

# Step 2: Undelete "spicy" (tombstone the tombstone's timestamp)
<#tomb-2> rdf:subject <#tomb-1>; rdf:predicate crdt:deletedAt; 
          rdf:object "2024-09-02T14:30:00Z"; crdt:deletedAt "2024-09-03T10:00:00Z" .

# Step 3: Delete "spicy" again (NEW timestamp, no recursion)  
<#tomb-3> rdf:subject :it; rdf:predicate schema:keywords; rdf:object "spicy";
          crdt:deletedAt "2024-09-04T16:00:00Z" .
```

**Key Insight:** Each deletion gets a fresh timestamp, so undeletion operations target specific historical events rather than creating infinite recursive chains.

**Deterministic Tombstone Fragment Identifier Algorithm:**

Since tombstones use RDF Reification, they integrate seamlessly with our standard CRDT merge algorithms via the `statement-v1` merge contract. To enable collaborative tombstone creation when multiple installations independently create tombstones for the same triple, we use deterministic identifier generation that ensures they target the same fragment identifier.

**Algorithm Specification:**

1. **Resolve Relative IRIs:** Convert all relative IRIs to absolute form using the document's base URI
2. **Canonicalize as N-Triple:** Serialize the triple using strict N-Triples format with absolute IRIs
3. **Generate Hash:** Apply XXH64 hash function to the canonical N-Triple string
4. **Format Identifier:** Use format `#crdt-tombstone-{8-char-hex-hash}`

**Example:**
```
Triple: <#it> schema:keywords "spicy"
Base URI: https://alice.podprovider.org/data/recipes/tomato-soup
Canonical: <https://alice.podprovider.org/data/recipes/tomato-soup#it> <https://schema.org/keywords> "spicy" .
Hash: XXH64("...") = a1b2c3d4e5f67890
Result: #crdt-tombstone-a1b2c3d4
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Pod Migration Limitation:** When documents are copied between pods, base URIs change, resulting in different tombstone identifiers for semantically equivalent tombstones. This is acceptable as equivalent tombstones merge correctly.
- **Blank Node Support:** Identifiable blank nodes (those with `sync:isIdentifying` declarations) can serve as tombstone subjects using their stable identity pattern. Non-identifiable blank nodes cannot be tombstoned as they lack stable identity across documents. See ARCHITECTURE.md section 3.3-3.4 for identification patterns.
- **Collision Resistance:** XXH64 provides sufficient collision resistance for practical use cases while maintaining compact identifiers.

#### 3.3.1. Tombstone Cleanup with Timestamps

**Cleanup Strategy:** Tombstones use `crdt:deletedAt` timestamps to enable time-based cleanup policies, separate from Hybrid Logical Clock causality determination.

**How Cleanup Works:**
Since tombstones store `crdt:deletedAt` timestamps, we can implement time-based garbage collection after a sufficient retention period. The cleanup timing is determined by the latest timestamp in the `crdt:deletedAt` set, not by Hybrid Logical Clock analysis.

**Cleanup Trade-offs:**
- **Time-based cleanup**: Simpler implementation, pragmatic retention policies, but may retain some redundant tombstones
- **Causality-based compaction**: Theoretically optimal, but requires complex Hybrid Logical Clock analysis and has fundamental flaws (see next section)

**Why Per-Tombstone Hybrid Logical Clocks Don't Work:**

Beyond storage overhead, per-tombstone Hybrid Logical Clocks have a fundamental semantic flaw that makes them impractical for tombstone compaction:

**The False Assumption:** "If installation X has Hybrid Logical Clock entry ≥ tombstone clock, then X has seen the deletion and the tombstone can be safely removed."

**The Reality:** Hybrid Logical Clocks track **causality** (what changes have been integrated), not **active readership** (who currently needs the tombstone). This creates a fundamental problem:

**The Scenario:** Active installation stops syncing a resource but retains Hybrid Logical Clock entry. Examples include changing sync patterns (only current month data), local storage cleanup, or switching to subset syncing (favorites only). Clock entry remains but installation never contributes updates to that resource again.

**The Core Problem:** Hybrid Logical Clock dominance requires that all referenced installations eventually contribute updates to surpass the tombstone's clock. But installations may stop reading the resource while still having clock entries, meaning the tombstone waits indefinitely for updates that will never happen.

**Alternative Approaches for Large-Scale Use:**
For applications where tombstone accumulation becomes problematic:
1. **Time-based cleanup**: Use `crdt:deletedAt` timestamps for retention-based tombstone removal (safer than causality-based)
2. **Resource splitting**: Partition large multi-value properties into separate documents with independent clocks
3. **Periodic rebuilding**: Occasionally recreate documents with clean state (requires coordination)

**Current Recommendation:**
Accept the storage trade-off in favor of implementation simplicity and correctness. Time-based cleanup using deletion timestamps provides practical garbage collection without the semantic problems of causality-based compaction.

### 3.4. RDF Reification Tombstone Design Summary

The final tombstone design addresses two key requirements:

1. **Mergeable RDF Data**: All tombstone statements are governed by the document-level merge contract (imported via `sync:includes mappings:statement-v1`), ensuring they can be properly merged as RDF data.

2. **Dual Timing System**: Tombstones use both Hybrid Logical Clocks and timestamps for different purposes:
   - **Hybrid Logical Clocks** for merge causality determination (who wins during conflicts)
   - **`crdt:deletedAt` timestamps** for deletion state and time-based cleanup policies
   - **Simplifies implementation** by separating concerns (causality vs cleanup)
   - **Enables cleanup** through retention policies while maintaining causality correctness
   - **Aligns with passive storage philosophy** by using standard RDF timestamps

This approach prioritizes simplicity and interoperability over storage optimization, consistent with the framework's core principles.

## 4. CRDT Mapping Validation and Blank Node Implementation

To prevent invalid configurations, implementations must validate CRDT mappings against resource identifiability requirements before allowing merge operations.

### 4.0. Detailed Blank Node Identification Patterns

This section provides comprehensive implementation guidance for the context-based identification mechanism outlined in ARCHITECTURE.md section 3.3.

#### Hybrid Logical Clock Entry Example

**Data with Identifiable Blank Nodes:**
```turtle
# These blank nodes can be identified via crdt:installationId within document context
<> crdt:hasClockEntry [
    crdt:installationId <https://alice.../installation-123> ;  # Identifying property
    crdt:logicalTime "15"^^xsd:long ;
    crdt:physicalTime "1693824600000"^^xsd:long
] .
```

**Predicate Mapping Declaration:**
Since Hybrid Logical Clock entries are typically typeless blank nodes, we use predicate-based mapping in our standard CRDT library:
```turtle
# Standard mapping for Hybrid Logical Clock entries (typeless blank nodes)  
<#clock-mappings> a sync:PredicateMapping;
   sync:rule
     [ sync:predicate crdt:installationId; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register; sync:isIdentifying true ],
     [ sync:predicate crdt:logicalTime; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register ],
     [ sync:predicate crdt:physicalTime; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register ] .
```

#### Compound Key Example

**Complex Blank Node with Multiple Identifying Properties:**
```turtle
# Example with compound identification key for nutrition info
mappings:nutrition-mappings-v1 a sync:PredicateMapping;
   sync:rule
     [ sync:predicate schema:calories; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register; sync:isIdentifying true ],
     [ sync:predicate schema:servingSize; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register; sync:isIdentifying true ],
     [ sync:predicate schema:protein; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register ] .  # Not identifying
```

#### Multi-Subject Reference Example

**Same Blank Node Referenced by Multiple Subjects:**
```turtle
# This blank node can be identified through multiple paths
:recipe1 schema:nutrition _:nutritionInfo .
:recipe2 schema:nutrition _:nutritionInfo .
_:nutritionInfo a schema:NutritionInformation ;
    schema:calories 250 ; 
    schema:servingSize "1 cup" .
```

**Identification Aliases:** Using the predicate-based pattern with compound key `schema:calories, schema:servingSize`, this blank node has multiple valid identifications:
- `(:recipe1, calories=250, servingSize="1 cup")` (context from :recipe1)
- `(:recipe2, calories=250, servingSize="1 cup")` (context from :recipe2)

In this case, both paths result in equivalent identification since they have the same identifying property values.

**Matching Across Documents:** For two blank nodes from different documents to be considered the same entity, **at least one of their identification aliases must match**. An identification alias is the unique combination of `(context, identifying properties)` where context is the subject identifier that references the blank node. If a blank node in Document A and a blank node in Document B share at least one identical identification alias, the framework treats them as the same resource, enabling their properties to be merged.

#### When Identity-Dependent CRDTs Fail

**The Technical Problem:** Identity-dependent CRDTs (OR-Set, 2P-Set) require comparing objects across documents to determine if a tombstone matches its target. With non-identifiable objects, this comparison fails.

**Example - OR-Set with Non-Identifiable Objects:**
```turtle
# Document A: Contains blank node + its tombstone
:recipe schema:keywords [rdfs:label "homemade"; custom:priority 1] .
<#crdt-tombstone-a1b2c3d4> a rdf:Statement;
  rdf:subject :recipe;
  rdf:predicate schema:keywords;
  rdf:object [rdfs:label "homemade"; custom:priority 1];
  crdt:deletedAt "2024-09-02T14:30:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .

# Document B: Contains similar but non-identical blank node  
:recipe schema:keywords [rdfs:label "homemade"; custom:priority 2] .
```

**The Comparison Problem:** The tombstone in document A refers to `[rdfs:label "homemade"; custom:priority 1]` but document B contains `[rdfs:label "homemade"; custom:priority 2]`. Are these the same object that should be tombstoned, or different objects that should coexist?

**Without Identity:** The framework cannot definitively answer this question. Different implementations might:
- Compare structural equality (same properties/values)
- Compare partial equality (ignore some properties)
- Use heuristics based on processing order

**Result:** Inconsistent merge behavior that violates CRDT convergence guarantees.

**Why Not Structural Equality?** A tempting solution would be to declare two blank nodes equal if and only if all their properties are identical. However, this creates a subtle trap: if a blank node has naturally identifying properties (like `rdfs:label`) mixed with mutable properties (like `custom:priority`), then editing the mutable properties silently breaks tombstone matching. The deletion operation fails without error, creating hard-to-debug data inconsistencies. Therefore, this specification explicitly prohibits structural equality comparison and requires explicit identification patterns.

**Solution Path:** This particular example could potentially be made identifiable by declaring `rdfs:label` as an identifying property using `sync:isIdentifying` in the mapping contract for `schema:keywords` properties. However, this only works when blank nodes have stable identifying properties that don't conflict across documents.

### 4.1. Identifiable vs Non-Identifiable Resources

**Identifiable Resources** (safe for all CRDT types):
- **IRI-identified resources:** Have globally unique, stable identifiers
- **Context-identified blank nodes:** Blank nodes with identifying properties declared via `sync:isIdentifying` within specific subject-predicate contexts

**Non-Identifiable Resources** (cause merge failures in identity-dependent CRDTs):
- **Standard blank nodes:** Document-scoped identifiers that cannot be matched across documents without explicit identification patterns

### 4.2. CRDT Compatibility Matrix

| CRDT Type | Identifiable Resources | Non-Identifiable Resources |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **LWW-Register** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported (atomic treatment) |
| **OR-Set** | ✅ Supported | ❌ **INVALID** - tombstone matching fails |
| **2P-Set** | ✅ Supported | ❌ **INVALID** - tombstone matching fails |
| **Sequence** | ✅ Supported | ❌ **INVALID** - element ordering undefined |

### 4.3. Validation Algorithm

```
validateMapping(property, crdtType, objectTypes):
  for each objectType in objectTypes:
    if crdtType in [OR_Set, 2P_Set, Sequence]:
      if not isIdentifiable(objectType):
        throw ValidationError("CRDT type " + crdtType + " requires identifiable resources, but property " + property + " contains non-identifiable " + objectType)
    
  return valid
```

### 4.4. Identifying Property Patterns and Precedence Rules

**Context-Identified Blank Nodes:** Blank nodes can become identifiable when mapping documents declare identifying properties using `sync:isIdentifying true` flags within rules.

**Example - Hybrid Logical Clock Mapping:**
```turtle
# Predicate-based mapping for Hybrid Logical Clock entries (typeless blank nodes)
mappings:clock-mappings-v1 a sync:PredicateMapping;
   sync:rule
     [ sync:predicate crdt:installationId; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register; sync:isIdentifying true ],
     [ sync:predicate crdt:logicalTime; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register ],
     [ sync:predicate crdt:physicalTime; crdt:mergeWith crdt:LWW_Register ] .
```

**Usage in Data:**
```turtle
# These blank nodes are now identifiable via declared pattern
<> crdt:hasClockEntry [
    crdt:installationId <https://alice.../installation-123> ;  # Identifying property
    crdt:logicalTime "15"^^xsd:long ;
    crdt:physicalTime "1693824600000"^^xsd:long
] .
```

**Complete Precedence Hierarchy:** When multiple mappings apply to the same predicate:

1. **Scope Priority:** Local ClassMapping > Local PredicateMapping > Imported DocumentMapping  
2. **List Order Priority:** Within same scope, first mapping in rdf:List wins for conflicting rules
3. **Property-Level Override:** Each rule property (`crdt:mergeWith`, `sync:isIdentifying`) resolves independently
4. **Inheritance Model:** Missing properties inherit from lower-priority scopes

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:** When multiple mappings define conflicting rules for the same predicate:
- **Deterministic Resolution:** First mapping in import order takes precedence
- **Conflict Logging:** Log warning about conflicting mappings for debugging
- **Continue Operation:** Use resolved rule and continue syncing (availability over strict validation)

**Override Examples:**
```turtle
# Complete precedence example
<> sync:imports ( 
    <https://standard-crdt.org/mappings/v1>   # Lowest priority (imported)
    <https://app-framework.org/mappings/v1>   
  ) ;
  sync:classMapping ( <#recipe-rules> ) ;     # Medium priority (local class)
  sync:predicateMapping ( <#app-predicates> ) . # Highest priority (local predicate)

# Local predicate mapping overrides everything
<#app-predicates> a sync:PredicateMapping;
   sync:rule [ sync:predicate my:customProp; crdt:mergeWith crdt:OR_Set; sync:isIdentifying true ] .

# Local class mapping overrides imported libraries  
<#recipe-rules> a sync:ClassMapping;
   sync:appliesToClass schema:Recipe;
   sync:rule [ sync:predicate schema:name; crdt:mergeWith crdt:OR_Set ] .
   # Result: schema:name uses OR_Set here, even if imports say LWW_Register

# Property-level inheritance example
<#partial-override> a sync:ClassMapping;
   sync:appliesToClass my:SpecialClass;
   sync:rule [ sync:predicate crdt:installationId; sync:isIdentifying false ] .
   # Result: keeps crdt:mergeWith from imported mappings, only changes identification
```

**Implementation Guidance:**
- **Conflict Detection:** Compare rules across all imported mappings during contract loading
- **Warning Messages:** Log specific conflicts with mapping URLs and predicate names for debugging
- **Validation Rule:** Recognize blank node patterns as identifiable when the effective rule (after precedence resolution) declares `sync:isIdentifying true`

### 4.5. Error Handling

**Invalid Mapping Detection:**
- Parse merge contracts during resource loading
- Check each property mapping against object type identifiability
- Reject resources with invalid mappings rather than risk data corruption

**Error Messages:**
```
Error: Property 'schema:keywords' uses OR-Set CRDT with non-identifiable blank node objects.
Solution: Use IRIs for objects or switch to LWW-Register for atomic treatment.
```

## 5. Merge Process Details

### 5.1. Full Merge Algorithm

```
mergeResources(localResource, remoteResource):
  1. loadMergeContract(document.sync:isGovernedBy)
  2. compareVectorClocks(local.clock, remote.clock)
  3. if local.clock == remote.clock:
       return local  // Identical state, no merge needed
  4. if remote.clock dominates local.clock:
       return fastForwardMerge(local, remote)
  5. if local.clock dominates remote.clock:
       return local  // No changes needed
  6. else: // concurrent changes
       return propertyLevelMerge(local, remote, mergeContract)
```

### 5.2. Property-Level Merge

```
propertyLevelMerge(local, remote, contract):
  result = createEmptyResource()
  for each property in contract.propertyMappings:
    localValue = local.getProperty(property.name)
    remoteValue = remote.getProperty(property.name)
    
    switch property.crdtType:
      case LWW_Register:
        result.setProperty(property.name, mergeLWW(localValue, remoteValue))
      case OR_Set:
        result.setProperty(property.name, mergeORSet(localValue, remoteValue))
      case FWW_Register:
        result.setProperty(property.name, mergeFWW(localValue, remoteValue))
      case Immutable:
        result.setProperty(property.name, mergeImmutable(localValue, remoteValue))
      // TODO: Add other CRDT types
  
  result.vectorClock = mergeClocks(local.clock, remote.clock)
  return result
```

### 5.3. Merge Algorithm Implementations

**FWW-Register (First-Writer-Wins) Merge:**
```
mergeFWW(localValue, localClock, remoteValue, remoteClock):
  // Handle empty/missing clocks first
  if localClock is empty and remoteClock is empty:
    if localValue == remoteValue:
      return localValue  // No conflict
    else:
      // Both uninitialized but different values - local wins deterministically
      return localValue
  elif localClock is empty and remoteClock is not empty:
    return remoteValue  // Remote was first to write
  elif localClock is not empty and remoteClock is empty:
    return localValue   // Local was first to write
    
  // Handle null values with present clocks
  if localValue == null and remoteValue != null:
    return remoteValue  // First write from remote
  
  if remoteValue == null and localValue != null:
    return localValue   // First write was local
    
  if localValue == remoteValue:
    return localValue   // Same value, no conflict
  
  // Conflict: different non-null values - use timestamp to determine first write
  if localClock dominates remoteClock:
    return remoteValue  // Remote was earlier (first)
  elif remoteClock dominates localClock:
    return localValue   // Local was earlier (first)  
  else:
    // Concurrent writes - use physical time tie-breaking for deterministic first-write
    if max(remoteClock.physicalTimes) < max(localClock.physicalTimes):
      return remoteValue  // Remote timestamp is earlier
    else:
      return localValue   // Local wins on tie-breaking
```

**Immutable Merge:**
```
mergeImmutable(localValue, localClock, remoteValue, remoteClock):
  // Handle empty/missing clocks first
  if localClock is empty and remoteClock is empty:
    if localValue == remoteValue:
      return localValue  // No conflict
    else:
      // Both uninitialized but different values - this is still an immutable conflict
      // Note: Unlike other CRDT types, Immutable maintains strict conflict detection
      throw ImmutableConflictException("Immutable property has conflicting uninitialized values: local=" + localValue + ", remote=" + remoteValue)
  elif localClock is empty and remoteClock is not empty:
    return remoteValue  // Remote was initialized first
  elif localClock is not empty and remoteClock is empty:
    return localValue   // Local was initialized first
    
  // Handle null values with present clocks
  if localValue == null and remoteValue != null:
    return remoteValue  // First write
  
  if remoteValue == null and localValue != null:
    return localValue   // First write was local
    
  if localValue == remoteValue:
    return localValue   // Same value, no conflict
  
  // Conflict: Immutable property has different values
  throw ImmutableConflictException("Immutable property has conflicting values: local=" + localValue + ", remote=" + remoteValue)
```

## 6. Edge Cases and Error Handling

### 6.1. Missing Merge Contracts
If a document's `sync:isGovernedBy` link points to a merge contract that is unavailable (e.g., due to network failure, or the resource was deleted), the document cannot be safely merged. 

**Policy:**
- **Document-Level Failure:** If the merge contract for a document is inaccessible, a client **MUST NOT** attempt to merge that document. It should be treated as temporarily offline-only. The client should periodically retry fetching the contract.
- **Property-Level Failure:** If a contract is successfully fetched but it does not contain a mapping rule for a specific predicate present in the document, that predicate **MUST NOT** be merged. The client should preserve its local value for the unmapped predicate and may log a warning.

### 6.2. Partial Resource Synchronization
- **TODO: Handle cases where only some properties are available**
- **FIXME: Hybrid Logical Clock semantics for partial updates**

### 6.3. Installation ID Conflicts
- **TODO: Handle duplicate installation IDs (though cryptographically unlikely)**
- **FIXME: Installation ID verification and validation**

### 6.4. Large Hybrid Logical Clocks
For documents that are edited by a very large number of installations over a long period, the document-level Hybrid Logical Clock can grow in size, potentially impacting performance and storage.

**Policy:** Naive pruning of Hybrid Logical Clock entries (e.g., removing the oldest entry) is **unsafe** as it destroys the causal history required for correct merging, and can lead to data divergence. 

A robust, general-purpose, and safe clock pruning algorithm requires coordination between installations and is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this core specification. For use cases with an extremely high number of collaborators, developers should consider architectural solutions, such as splitting the document into smaller, more focused documents with independent clocks.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### 7.1. Performance Optimizations
- **Incremental Merging:** Instead of creating a new merged resource from scratch, a more memory-efficient approach is to calculate a diff or patch and apply it to the local resource. This is especially effective for large resources with small changes.
- **Efficient Clock Representation:** Hybrid Logical Clocks can be stored in memory as sorted lists or maps for efficient lookups and comparisons. For persistence, installation ID IRIs can be compressed using a local mapping (e.g., to integers) to reduce storage size.

### 7.2. Concurrency Control
- **Atomic Updates:** The process of merging and persisting the new state MUST be atomic. An implementation should ensure that a failure during a write operation does not leave the local storage in an inconsistent state. A common pattern is to write the new resource to a temporary file and then atomically rename it to its final destination.
- **Locking:** While the merge algorithm itself is deterministic, the process of reading the local state, merging, and writing it back should be treated as a single transaction to prevent race conditions with other local operations.

## 8. Testing and Validation

A robust implementation of this specification requires a comprehensive test suite. The following strategies are recommended:

### 8.1. Convergence Properties
- **Property-Based Testing:** Use property-based testing frameworks (like `QuickCheck` or `Hypothesis`) to generate long, random sequences of concurrent operations applied to multiple replicas. The test should assert that all replicas eventually converge to the identical state after all operations are merged.
- **Formal Modeling:** For critical components, consider using a formal methods tool like TLA+ or Alloy to prove that the algorithms satisfy the required CRDT properties (associativity, commutativity, idempotence).

### 8.2. Interoperability and Conformance
- **Common Test Suite:** A shared conformance test suite should be developed. This suite would contain a set of reference resources, merge scenarios, and their expected outcomes. Different client implementations can run against this suite to ensure they are fully interoperable.
- **Vocabulary Versioning:** The test suite must include scenarios for handling changes in the `crdt`, `sync`, and `idx` vocabularies, as well as in the application-specific merge contracts. This includes testing for both backward and forward compatibility where applicable.

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Semantic Consistency**: How to handle semantic constraints that might be violated during merge?
2. **Schema Evolution**: How to handle changes in merge contracts over time?
3. **Performance Boundaries**: At what resource size/complexity should we recommend different approaches?
4. **Security Implications**: How to prevent malicious Hybrid Logical Clock manipulation?
5. **Blank Nodes** Do the algorithms break for Blank Nodes? rdf:List? rdf:Seq? etc.
