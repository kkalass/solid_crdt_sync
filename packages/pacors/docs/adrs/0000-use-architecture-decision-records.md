# ADR-0000: Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Context
As the pacors package evolves, we need a systematic way to document important architectural decisions, especially during the early development phase where fundamental design choices need to be made and tracked.

Key challenges:
- Multiple architectural decisions needed for local-first sync design
- Complex interactions between RDF mapping, CRDT algorithms, and Solid Pod integration
- Need to track rationale for future reference and onboarding
- Work-in-progress nature requires flexibility in decision status

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions for the pacors package.

ADRs will be stored in `/packages/pacors/docs/adrs/` and follow this structure:
- Numbered sequentially (0000, 0001, etc.)
- Include status: PROPOSED, RESEARCH, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, SUPERSEDED
- Follow standard ADR template
- README.md provides overview of current status

## Consequences
### Positive
- Structured documentation of architectural reasoning
- Easy to track evolution of decisions
- Self-contained documents that don't require external tools
- Can be easily migrated to GitHub Issues later
- Searchable and version-controlled

### Negative  
- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain

## Implementation
- Use template.md for consistent structure
- README.md tracks open/critical decisions
- Status workflow: PROPOSED → RESEARCH → ACCEPTED/REJECTED
